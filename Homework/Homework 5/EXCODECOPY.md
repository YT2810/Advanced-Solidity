**Here's the list of examples you came up with for using `EXTCODECOPY`:**

1. **Factory Contracts**: A factory contract deploys other contracts and might use `EXTCODECOPY` to verify or copy the code of the deployed contracts.
   ```solidity
   EXTCODECOPY(childContractAddress, memoryLocation, codeOffset, size);
   ```

2. **Nested Contracts**: Contracts that create or interact with other contracts (nested contracts) might use `EXTCODECOPY` to examine or copy the code of the nested contracts.
   ```solidity
   EXTCODECOPY(nestedContractAddress, memoryLocation, codeOffset, size);
   ```

These examples show how you can inspect or copy code from other contracts directly.
